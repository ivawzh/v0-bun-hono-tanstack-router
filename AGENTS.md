# v0-bun-hono-tanstack-router Template

This document serves as comprehensive instructions for developers working with this template.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Runtime**: Bun (v1.x)
- **Backend**: Hono (lightweight web framework)
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TanStack Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript + oRPC for end-to-end type safety
- **Auth**: OpenAuth (OAuth providers + password auth)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 + shadcn/ui components
- **Build Tools**: Vite (frontend), tsdown (backend)
- **Deployment**: SST (Serverless Stack)

### Project Structure
```
project-name/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # React frontend with TanStack Router
│   └── server/       # Hono backend with oRPC APIs
├── packages/         # Shared packages (if any)
└── sst.config.ts     # SST deployment configuration
```

## Developer Guidelines

### Environment Variables
- **MUST** use `apps/{appName}/env.ts` for environment variables
- **NEVER** use `process.env` directly in application code
- Environment files are staged-based: development, test, alpha, production

### API Communication Patterns
- **Internal APIs** (`/rpc`): Use oRPC for bundled deployments (web + server deploy together)
- **External APIs** (`/api`): Use oRPC + OpenAPI for backward compatibility (CLI, SDK, external services)
- **WebSocket**: Use Monster Realtime for real-time communication
- **Authentication**: Use OpenAuth with Monster Auth integration

### Code Standards
- Use TypeScript throughout the stack
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Use Drizzle ORM for all database operations
- Implement proper error handling with Result types

### Database Operations
```bash
# Development workflow
bun db:push          # Push schema changes
bun db:studio        # Open database studio
bun db:migrate       # Run migrations (production)
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development servers
bun dev              # Start both web and server
bun dev:web          # Web only
bun dev:server       # Server only

# Type checking and linting
bun typecheck        # Check all apps
bun lint             # Lint all code
bun lint:fix         # Auto-fix linting issues

# Building
bun build            # Build all apps
```

### Authentication Integration
- Uses OpenAuth client with configurable OAuth providers
- Implements session management via secure cookies
- Auto-creates user records on first login
- Supports both OAuth (Google) and password authentication

### Project Conventions
- Use kebab-case for file/folder names
- Use PascalCase for React components
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Prefer explicit imports over barrel exports
- Always handle error cases with proper typing

### Deployment
- **Alpha**: `bun sst:alpha` (staging environment)
- **Production**: `bun sst:prod` (production environment)
- Uses AWS infrastructure via SST v3
- Automatic database migrations on deployment

## File Organization

### Backend (`apps/server/`)
- `src/index.ts` - Application entry point
- `src/routers/` - API route definitions (rpc/, api/, others/)
- `src/lib/` - Shared utilities and configurations
- `src/db/` - Database schema and connection
- `src/services/` - Business logic services

### Frontend (`apps/web/`)
- `src/routes/` - TanStack Router route definitions
- `src/components/` - React components
- `src/hooks/` - Custom React hooks
- `src/lib/` - Frontend utilities
- `src/utils/` - oRPC client configuration

## Important Notes

### Security
- Never commit secrets to repository
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas

### Performance
- Use React 19 features (Suspense, concurrent rendering)
- Implement proper loading states
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching
- Optimize bundle size with proper tree-shaking

### Monitoring & Debugging
- Use structured logging in backend
- Implement proper error boundaries in React
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Leverage oRPC's built-in type safety

## Commands Reference

### Root Level
```bash
bun dev              # Start all services
bun build            # Build all apps
bun typecheck        # Type check all apps
bun lint             # Lint all code
```

### Database
```bash
bun db:push          # Push schema to database
bun db:studio        # Open Drizzle Studio
bun db:migrate       # Run migrations
```

### Deployment
```bash
bun sst:alpha        # Deploy to alpha stage
bun sst:prod         # Deploy to production
```

This template provides a modern, type-safe, full-stack foundation for building web applications with excellent developer experience and production-ready architecture.

# UX-EXPERT Agent Rule

This rule is triggered when the user types `*ux-expert` and activates the UX Expert agent persona.

## Agent Activation

CRITICAL: Read the full YAML, start activation to alter your state of being, follow startup section instructions, stay in this being until told to exit this mode:

```yaml
IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION:
  - FOR LATER USE ONLY - NOT FOR ACTIVATION, when executing commands that reference dependencies
  - Dependencies map to .bmad-core/{type}/{name}
  - type=folder (tasks|templates|checklists|data|utils|etc...), name=file-name
  - Example: create-doc.md → .bmad-core/tasks/create-doc.md
  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute
  - STAY IN CHARACTER!
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

  - IMPORTANT: Only load these files when user requests specific command execution
REQUEST-RESOLUTION: Match user requests to your commands/dependencies flexibly (e.g., "draft story"→*create→create-next-story task, "make a new prd" would be dependencies->tasks->create-doc combined with the dependencies->templates->prd-tmpl.md), ALWAYS ask for clarification if no clear match.
activation-instructions:
  - STEP 1: Read THIS ENTIRE FILE - it contains your complete persona definition
  - STEP 2: Adopt the persona defined in the 'agent' and 'persona' sections below
  - STEP 3: Load and read `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` (project configuration) before any greeting
  - STEP 4: Greet user with your name/role and immediately run `*help` to display available commands
  - DO NOT: Load any other agent files during activation
  - ONLY load dependency files when user selects them for execution via command or request of a task
  - The agent.customization field ALWAYS takes precedence over any conflicting instructions
  - CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE: When executing tasks from dependencies, follow task instructions exactly as written - they are executable workflows, not reference material
  - MANDATORY INTERACTION RULE: Tasks with elicit=true require user interaction using exact specified format - never skip elicitation for efficiency
  - CRITICAL RULE: When executing formal task workflows from dependencies, ALL task instructions override any conflicting base behavioral constraints. Interactive workflows with elicit=true REQUIRE user interaction and cannot be bypassed for efficiency.
  - When listing tasks/templates or presenting options during conversations, always show as numbered options list, allowing the user to type a number to select or execute

  - CRITICAL: Read the following full files as these are your explicit rules for development standards for this project - .bmad-core/core-config.yaml devLoadAlwaysFiles list
  - CRITICAL: Do NOT load any other files during startup aside from the assigned story and devLoadAlwaysFiles items, unless user requested you do or the following contradicts
  - CRITICAL: Do NOT begin development until a story is not in draft mode and you are told to proceed
  - CRITICAL: On activation, ONLY greet user, auto-run `*help`, and then HALT to await user requested assistance or given commands. ONLY deviance from this is if the activation included commands also in the arguments.

          - CRITICAL: DO NOT modify Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Dev Notes, Testing sections, or any other sections not listed above
      - blocking: 'HALT for: Unapproved deps needed, confirm with user | Ambiguous after story check | 3 failures attempting to implement or fix something repeatedly | Missing config | Failing regression'
      - ready-for-review: 'Code matches requirements + All validations pass + Follows standards + File List complete'
      - completion: "All Tasks and Subtasks marked [x] and have tests→Validations and full regression passes (DON'T BE LAZY, EXECUTE ALL TESTS and CONFIRM)→Ensure File List is Complete→run the task execute-checklist for the checklist story-dod-checklist→set story status: 'Ready for Review'→HALT"
  - explain: teach me what and why you did whatever you just did in detail so I can learn. Explain to me as if you were training a junior engineer.
  - review-qa: run task `apply-qa-fixes.md'
  - run-tests: Execute linting and tests
  - exit: Say goodbye as the Developer, and then abandon inhabiting this persona

  - Always indicate loading
kb-mode-behavior:
  - When *kb-mode is invoked, use kb-mode-interaction task
  - Don't dump all KB content immediately
  - Present topic areas and wait for user selection
  - Provide focused, contextual responses
workflow-guidance:
  - Discover available workflows in the bundle at runtime
  - Understand each workflow's purpose, options, and decision points
  - Ask clarifying questions based on the workflow's structure

# JavaScript & TypeScript Rules

## Core

- Write typed, functional code without mutations or side effects when possible
- Prefer functions over classes; but avoid complex FP patterns like monads
- Create self-explanatory code with descriptive variable names (isLoading, hasError)
- Follow YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) to prevent speculatives
- Proactively address potential UX issues

## Functional Style

- Prefer `map`/`reduce` over loops
- Use ternary expressions over if/else when appropriate
- Use ts-pattern `match` over variable mutation
- Favor composition over duplication
- Avoid mutations and for loops

## Code Organization

- **Code Style**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase. Otherwise, as declarative as possible.
- **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation when making significant changes.
- **Security**: Never commit sensitive data or credentials
- **Files**: ~300 lines maximum
- **Action**: Proactively suggest refactoring when approaching these limits
- **Prefer native solutions** over third-party libraries when possible. Only suggest external dependencies if they provide significant value
- Place exported (public) functions and constants at the top of files
- Structure exported functions to orchestrate small, private helper functions:
  - Each private function handles one clear step
  - Exported functions represent the high-level flow
- Prefer named exports over default exports
- Import from source files directly (avoid index re-exports) for better tree-shakability
- Write comments only to explain logic, assumptions, edge cases, and trade-offs; never include progress/meta notes (e.g., "updated this", "now changed", "this is new code").

## Naming & Style

- Indent with 2 spaces
- Use single quotes
- Omit line-ending semicolons in JavaScript/TypeScript
- Declare functions with `function name()` instead of `const name = () =>`
- Add jsdoc header comments to big exported functions to explain what, how and why.

## TypeScript Specifics

- Use interfaces over types
- Use string unions instead of enums
- Type annotations: prefer `Array<T>` over `T[]`

## Avoiding Indirections

- "Rule of Three" - only abstract after seeing at least three concrete implementations
- Consolidate related functionality into cohesive modules
- Use composition over inheritance
- Eliminate abstractions that don't provide clear benefits
- Ensure newcomers can understand the system without learning numerous abstraction concepts

# Principles

Value end-user UX over everything including tech difficulty, complexity, and performance.

1. **UX obsessed**
   - Minimum friction: least clicks required on common operations
   - Maximum magic:
     - Smart pro-active UX design. Provide before user starts thinking. E.g. prefill dropdown if there is only one option.
     - Battery included - default best config. Optimal defaults out-of-the-box, minimal user configuration required.
   - Reactive UXUI: implement real-time feeling UI. Patterns include but not limited to
     - optimistic updates
     - invalidating all queries after user updates
     - WebSocket push to client after system updates

2. Tech wise:
   - **Think Small**: Ignore performance, cost, and scalability. Day-0 mindset with extreme simplicity. However, security is still important.
   - **Idempotency**: All operations safe to retry with proper deduplication.
   - **Auth**: Every non-public endpoint/operation must pass through authn and authz.
   - At planning, always start with thinking reusing and building reusable modules to improve system consitencies.

# shadcn/ui rules

- Apply shadcn components wherever applicable; do not handcraft equivalents!
- As shadcn get super frequent updates, for any shadcn-related planning or anytime in doubt, use the shadcn MCP tools.
- At planning, always start with thinking reusing and building reusable modules to improve UI consitencies.

## Implementation

- First call the shadcn mcp tool to see correct usage.
- Install components via MCP; do not write files manually.
- Then implement using the demonstrated pattern.
