# Current Mission State

- **Active mission**: _none yet (next mission to kick off: `0001-domain-architecture`)_
- **Last updated**: _(set by planning agent — update this timestamp when you pick up a mission)_

## How to Use This File
1. When you begin a mission, update **Active mission** with the mission id + short name and append a dated log entry under "Mission Progress Log".
2. After completing Kickoff Step 4, add a short summary of the agreed scope for traceability.
3. At mission completion, mark it as done in its `.mission.md`, update the log here with outcome + link to follow-up notes, then set **Active mission** to `_none_` or to the next mission.
4. If you have to pause mid-mission, record blockers and pending tasks in the log so the next agent can resume quickly.
