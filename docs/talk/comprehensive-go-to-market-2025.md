# Solo Unicorn: Comprehensive Go-to-Market Master Plan 2025

## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool focused on AI task management. Current vision includes:
- CLI SDK for user authentication and repo initialization
- MCP tool integration for AI agent task management
- Passive backend communication for task pushing
- Potential backend architecture changes for scalability

## Executive Summary

Solo Unicorn should pivot to become the **"GitHub for AI Workflows"** - a CLI-first developer tool that orchestrates AI agents across development projects. The market timing is perfect as developers struggle to manage increasingly complex AI-assisted workflows.

**Key Insight**: While others focus on AI coding assistance, Solo Unicorn uniquely positions itself as the **orchestration layer** between human planning and AI execution.

## Market Landscape Analysis

### Current AI Dev Tools Ecosystem

**Code Generation Focus:**
- Cursor: AI-first editor with context awareness
- GitHub Copilot: Integrated AI pair programming
- Aider: CLI-based AI coding assistant
- Continue: Open-source autopilot for IDEs

**Task Management (Generic):**
- Linear: Developer-focused issue tracking
- Notion: All-in-one workspace
- GitHub Projects: Basic kanban boards
- Jira: Enterprise (often disliked by developers)

**CLI Developer Tools:**
- Vercel CLI: Deployment orchestration
- Railway CLI: Infrastructure management
- gh CLI: GitHub operations
- Firebase CLI: Backend services

### Market Gap: AI Workflow Orchestration

**The Missing Piece:** No tool effectively bridges human task planning with AI agent execution in development workflows.

**Problems Solo Unicorn Solves:**
1. **AI Context Switching**: Developers lose context when switching between tasks and AI tools
2. **Workflow Fragmentation**: Task planning happens separately from AI execution
3. **Team Coordination**: No visibility into AI agent work across team members
4. **AI Task Persistence**: AI conversations don't persist across sessions

## Strategic Positioning

### Core Value Proposition

**"The Command Center for AI-Assisted Development"**

Solo Unicorn becomes the single interface where developers:
- Plan and break down development tasks
- Dispatch work to AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- Monitor AI progress and results
- Collaborate on AI-driven projects

### Differentiation Matrix
