# Solo Unicorn CLI SaaS Platform: Market Master Plan 2025

## Original Request

Transform Solo Unicorn from a local-first task management system into a SaaS dev tool platform focused on AI task orchestration via CLI SDK. Core idea:
1. CLI SDK for user authentication and repo registration
2. MCP tool integration for AI agents to manage tasks
3. Passive backend communication for task dispatching
4. Separate code agent logic from current lambda-targeted backend

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Pivot to AI Task Orchestration Platform with CLI SDK**

Solo Unicorn should position itself as the **"GitHub Actions for AI Development"** - a SaaS platform that orchestrates AI coding agents across development workflows. This strategic pivot leverages the proven local architecture while creating a scalable B2B SaaS business model targeting the rapidly growing AI development tools market.
