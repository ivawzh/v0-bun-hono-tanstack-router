# Solo Unicorn 2025: Market Push Implementation Plan

## Original Request
Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool focused on AI task management, involving CLI SDK, MCP integration, backend communication, and potential architecture evolution from the current Lambda-focused design.

## Executive Summary & Key Insight

After analyzing previous market strategies and the current competitive landscape, I've identified a critical insight: **Solo Unicorn should position as the "Git for AI Workflows"** - providing version control and orchestration for AI development tasks rather than trying to be another project management tool.

The market opportunity lies in solving the **"AI Context Switching Problem"** - developers lose context when moving between different AI tools, and there's no standardized way to maintain, version, and share AI-assisted development workflows.

## Fresh Market Analysis (Post-2024 Developments)

### Key Market Shifts Since 2024
1. **MCP Standardization**: Model Context Protocol is now widely adopted across Claude, GPT, Gemini, and open-source models
2. **AI Agent Fatigue**: Developers are overwhelmed by scattered AI tools and want consolidation
3. **Context Persistence Problem**: Major pain point identified - AI agents lose context between sessions
4. **Workflow Reproducibility**: Teams struggle to share and reproduce successful AI-assisted development patterns

### Competitive Gap Analysis
After reviewing existing tools, there's a clear gap:
- **Cursor/Claude Code**: Great for coding, poor for workflow orchestration
- **GitHub Copilot Workspace**: Microsoft ecosystem lock-in, not workflow-focused
- **Linear/Notion**: Project management, not AI-workflow specific
- **Zapier/n8n**: General automation, not developer-focused

**Solo Unicorn's Unique Position**: The only tool designed specifically for versioning, sharing, and orchestrating AI development workflows.

## Strategic Positioning: "Git for AI Workflows"

### Core Value Proposition
1. **Version Control for AI Tasks**: Track evolution of task descriptions, AI responses, and outcomes
2. **Workflow Templates**: Create reusable patterns for common AI-assisted development tasks
3. **Context Persistence**: Maintain project memory across multiple AI agents and sessions
4. **Team Collaboration**: Share successful AI workflows and learnings

### Key Differentiators
- **CLI-Native**: Developers can work entirely in terminal/IDE
- **Tool-Agnostic**: Works with any AI agent that supports MCP
- **Local-First**: Data stays local, only workflows and templates sync to cloud
- **Reproducible**: Any team member can reproduce exact AI-assisted workflows

## Solution Architecture: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Local-First with Cloud Templates (Months 1-3)
```
┌─ Local Development ─┐    ┌─ Cloud Services ─┐
│                     │    │                  │
│ CLI SDK             │◄──►│ Template Gallery │
│ ├─ Task Versioning  │    │ ├─ Workflow Lib  │
│ ├─ MCP Integration  │    │ ├─ Team Sync     │
│ ├─ Context Mgmt     │    │ └─ Analytics     │
│ └─ Local DB         │    │                  │
│                     │    │ Lightweight API  │
└─────────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘
```

**Why This Approach**:
- Low friction: Developers control their data
- Fast iteration: No network dependencies for core features
- Easy adoption: Works offline, familiar Git-like commands
- Scalable revenue: Premium templates and team features

### Core Commands (CLI Interface)
```bash
# Initialize project
solo init [project-name]

# Add task with AI context
solo add "Implement user auth" --context="using NextJS + Supabase"

# Execute with AI agent
solo run task-123 --agent=claude --mode=plan

# Version and commit workflow
solo commit -m "Added auth workflow pattern"

# Share workflow template
solo push template auth-nextjs-supabase

# Use community template
solo pull template react-testing-workflow
```

### Technical Stack Evolution

**Current Architecture Challenges**:
- Lambda-focused backend limits real-time communication
- WebSocket implementation in Bun may not scale
- PostgreSQL good for structured data, but need better AI context storage

**Proposed Evolution**:

#### Local Components
- **CLI SDK**: Rust or Go for performance and single binary distribution
- **Local Database**: SQLite for task data + Vector DB for AI context
- **MCP Server**: Embedded in CLI, auto-configures with AI agents

#### Cloud Components  
- **Template API**: Minimal REST API for workflow sharing
- **Analytics Service**: Usage patterns and workflow effectiveness
- **Team Sync**: Optional real-time collaboration via WebSocket

#### Why Hybrid Works
- **Privacy**: Sensitive code/tasks stay local
- **Performance**: No latency for core operations
- **Collaboration**: Teams can still share workflows and templates
- **Monetization**: Premium templates, team features, analytics
