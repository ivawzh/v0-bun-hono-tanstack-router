# CLI/SDK Generic Tool Market Strategy

## Executive Summary
Transform Solo Unicorn from local dev tool to generic CLI/SDK platform for AI task orchestration with client-server architecture, passive communication, and cloud-based task management.

## Task Information
- **Title**: master plan to become a generic tool and push to market
- **Description**: Make Solo Unicorn a dev tool focused on AI task management only. Add CLI/SDK/EXE client with login, repo init, MCP tools, passive backend communication, and client-side agent invocation. Backend stores tasks, CLI receives commands and spawns agents locally. Consider WebSocket solutions (Lambda vs Elixir vs Bun on EC2).

## Analysis: First-Principles Architecture

### Current State vs. Target State
**Current**: Monolithic web app running locally with direct agent spawning
**Target**: Distributed CLI/SDK + cloud backend with task orchestration

### Core Problem Decomposition
1. **Task Management**: Centralized in cloud for persistence and coordination
2. **Code Execution**: Local on client machine for security and performance  
3. **Communication**: Bidirectional push/pull between cloud and CLI
4. **Authentication**: Project-user based authorization across distributed system
5. **Agent Orchestration**: CLI spawns local agents based on cloud task assignments

### Essential Components
1. **CLI Client**: Authentication, repo registration, MCP integration, agent spawning
2. **Cloud Backend**: Task storage, push notifications, user management
3. **WebSocket Layer**: Real-time communication between cloud and CLI
4. **MCP Integration**: AI agents update tasks via standardized protocol
5. **Authentication System**: JWT-based with project-user authorization

- **CLI Client**: Go for single binary distribution and developer experience
- **Authentication**: Extend Monster Auth with CLI-specific flows

### Technical Implementation

#### Phase 1: CLI Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
```bash
# Core CLI commands
solo auth login              # OAuth flow in browser
solo init <repo-path>        # Register repo with backend
solo task create "Task"      # Create task via API
solo task list              # List assigned tasks
solo agent connect          # Setup MCP integration
solo daemon start           # Background process for task listening
```

**CLI Architecture**:
```go
// cmd/
├── auth.go      # OAuth and JWT management
├── init.go      # Repo registration
├── task.go      # Task CRUD operations
├── agent.go     # AI agent spawning and MCP setup
└── daemon.go    # Background WebSocket client

// internal/
├── api/         # REST API client
├── websocket/   # WebSocket client for task pushes
├── mcp/         # MCP server implementation
├── storage/     # Local config and cache
└── agent/       # Agent spawning logic
```

#### Phase 2: WebSocket Infrastructure (Weeks 5-8)
**Elixir Phoenix WebSocket Server**:
```elixir
# Phoenix Channels for real-time communication
defmodule SoloUnicorn.TaskChannel do
  use Phoenix.Channel
  
  def join("task:" <> project_id, _payload, socket) do
    # Authenticate user for project
    # Subscribe to task updates
  end
  
  def handle_info({:task_assigned, task}, socket) do
    push(socket, "task_assigned", %{task: task})
  end
end
```

**Benefits**:
- Handle 1M+ concurrent connections on single server
- Built-in clustering for horizontal scaling  
- Perfect for task assignment and status updates
- Phoenix LiveView for real-time web dashboard

#### Phase 3: Docker & Generic Protocol (Weeks 9-12)
**Docker CLI Support**:
```dockerfile
# CLI runs inside container with repo mounted
FROM golang:alpine
COPY solo-cli /usr/local/bin/solo
WORKDIR /workspace
CMD ["solo", "daemon", "start"]
```

**Generic Auth Protocol**:
- Project-scoped JWT tokens
- Role-based permissions (owner, collaborator, viewer)
- API key rotation for security
- Multi-provider OAuth (GitHub, Google, Microsoft)

### Local Development Experience

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Terminal 1: Elixir WebSocket server
cd apps/websocket-server
mix phx.server

# Terminal 2: Node.js API server  
cd apps/server
bun dev

# Terminal 3: React web dashboard
cd apps/web
bun dev

# Terminal 4: CLI development
cd cli
go run main.go daemon start
```

#### Integration Testing
```bash
# E2E test flow
solo auth login --dev-mode
solo init /path/to/test-repo
solo task create "Test task"
# Verify task appears in web dashboard
# Verify WebSocket push triggers agent spawn
```

### Cost Analysis

#### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
- **Elixir Phoenix Server**: $20-50 (EC2 t3.small-medium)
- **Node.js API Server**: $0-20 (Railway/Render free tier initially)
- **PostgreSQL**: $0-15 (Neon/Supabase free tier initially)  
- **CDN for CLI binaries**: $0-5 (CloudFlare)
- **Total**: $20-90/month initially

#### Scaling Costs
- **1K users**: $50-100/month
- **10K users**: $200-500/month
- **100K users**: $1K-3K/month

### Remote Repo & Cloud Coding Future
The CLI architecture naturally enables remote capabilities:

```bash
# Future remote repo support
solo repo add --remote git@github.com:user/repo.git
solo agent spawn --remote --instance-type=c5.xlarge

# Cloud coding without local CLI
# CLI runs in cloud container, user accesses via web terminal
# Same MCP integration, same task management
# Just different execution environment
```
