# Solo Unicorn Dev Tool Commercialization - Master Plan 2025

## Original Request

Transform Solo Unicorn from a local-first task management system into a market-ready dev tool focused on AI task management. The core vision is to create a CLI SDK that enables:

1. User authentication with JWT access and refresh tokens
2. Repository initialization and agent registration with backend
3. MCP tool integration for AI agents to update/create tasks
4. Passive communication enabling backend-to-agent task pushing

The current architecture may need significant uplift, potentially separating agent running logic and implementing robust push communication (possibly WebSocket with Elixir), as the current JS server is Lambda-focused.

2. **Add API Gateway**: Implement authentication and rate limiting
3. **Implement WebSocket Layer**: Enable real-time bidirectional communication
4. **Database Optimization**: Add indexing, caching, and connection pooling
5. **Containerization**: Migrate to Kubernetes for auto-scaling

**CLI Implementation (Rust):**

**Core Components:**
```rust
// Authentication management
struct AuthManager {
    access_token: Option<String>,
    refresh_token: Option<String>,
    api_client: HttpClient,
}

// Repository state management
struct RepoManager {
    git_repo: GitRepository,
    registered_agents: Vec<Agent>,
    active_tasks: Vec<Task>,
}

// Real-time communication
struct WebSocketManager {
    connection: WebSocketStream,
    message_handler: MessageHandler,
    reconnect_strategy: ReconnectStrategy,
}
```

**Key CLI Commands:**
```bash
# Authentication
solo-unicorn login
solo-unicorn logout

# Repository management
solo-unicorn init                    # Initialize current repo
solo-unicorn agents add claude-code  # Add AI agent
solo-unicorn agents list             # List registered agents

# Task management
solo-unicorn tasks create "Implement user auth"
solo-unicorn tasks list
solo-unicorn tasks assign <task-id> <agent-id>

# Real-time monitoring
solo-unicorn monitor                 # Watch for incoming tasks
solo-unicorn dashboard              # Open web dashboard
```

### Backend Services Architecture

**WebSocket Service (Elixir/Phoenix):**

**Advantages of Elixir:**
- Exceptional concurrency (millions of lightweight processes)
- Built-in fault tolerance and supervision trees
- Low-latency real-time communication
- Horizontal scaling capabilities

**Alternative: Node.js with Socket.io**
- Easier team hiring and maintenance
- Shared language with existing codebase
- Good performance for moderate scale

**Recommendation**: Start with Node.js for faster development, migrate to Elixir as scale demands increase.
