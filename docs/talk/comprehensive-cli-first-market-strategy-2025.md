# Comprehensive CLI-First Market Strategy 2025

## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a developer tool focused on AI task management. The proposed approach centers on a CLI SDK that enables:

1. User authentication with JWT tokens
2. `init` command for repo and agent registration  
3. MCP tools integration for AI task updates
4. Passive backend communication for task pushing
5. Potential backend infrastructure upgrades (e.g., Elixir WebSocket server)

The goal is to transform Solo Unicorn from a local-first tool into a distributed dev tool SaaS platform.
