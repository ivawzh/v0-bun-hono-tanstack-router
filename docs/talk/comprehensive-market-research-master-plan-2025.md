# Solo Unicorn: Comprehensive Market Research Master Plan 2025

## Executive Summary

Solo Unicorn has significant market potential as a specialized AI task management platform for developers. The research shows a $6-7B software development tools market growing at 17% CAGR, with strong developer adoption of AI coding tools (76% using or planning to use AI assistants). The CLI SDK approach aligns with successful models like Aider (open-source BYOK), Linear (developer-focused PM), and MCP standardization trends.

**Recommended Strategy**: Position as the "Linear for AI Development" - a developer-first task management system that orchestrates AI agents across multiple repositories with seamless CLI integration.

## Original Request Analysis

Your vision centers on transforming Solo Unicorn from a local-only tool into a distributed dev tool platform:

1. **CLI SDK Strategy**: Users authenticate, register repos/agents, and communicate via MCP tools
2. **Passive Communication**: Backend pushes tasks to agents via robust real-time channels
3. **Infrastructure Upgrade**: Move from Lambda-focused JS to scalable WebSocket architecture (suggesting Elixir)

This approach targets the intersection of AI coding assistants, developer productivity tools, and project management - a rapidly growing market segment.
