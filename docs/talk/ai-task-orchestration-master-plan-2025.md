# Solo Unicorn: AI Task Orchestration Master Plan 2025

## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool. The current idea is to make Solo Unicorn solely responsible for AI task management, with coding executed on user machines. The proposed approach includes:

1. Custom CLI SDK with user authentication (JWT)
2. Repository and agent registration via `init` command
3. MCP tools for AI agents to update/create tasks
4. Passive communication to backend for task pushing

Backend may need architectural upgrades to separate agent running logic and implement robust push communication (possibly WebSocket server with Elixir).

## Market Analysis

### Current Market Landscape

**AI Developer Tools Market:**
- Market size: $6.36B in 2024, projected to reach $27.07B by 2033 (17.47% CAGR)

## Recommendations

### Strategic Recommendations

**1. Pursue Option 1: SaaS Platform with CLI SDK**
This approach offers the best balance of time-to-market, scalability, and revenue potential while leveraging existing Solo Unicorn strengths.

**2. Focus on Developer Experience**
CLI tools succeed or fail based on developer experience. Invest heavily in:
- Intuitive command structure
- Excellent error messages and debugging
- Comprehensive documentation
- Fast response times

**3. Build Community Early**
Open-source the CLI components and build an active community before scaling. This creates network effects and reduces customer acquisition costs.

**4. Strategic Partnership with Anthropic**
Given Solo Unicorn's dependence on Claude Code, establishing a formal partnership could provide competitive advantages and potentially reduce rate limiting issues.

### Technical Recommendations

**1. Multi-Tenant Backend Architecture**
Upgrade the current backend to support multi-tenancy with proper user isolation, resource quotas, and rate limiting.

**2. WebSocket Communication Layer**
Implement real-time communication for task pushing and status updates. Consider Elixir/Phoenix for WebSocket handling if Node.js/Bun proves insufficient.

**3. CLI Distribution Strategy**
Use established package managers (npm, Homebrew, Chocolatey) and implement auto-update mechanisms for seamless user experience.

**4. MCP Integration Enhancements**
Extend the current MCP implementation to support additional AI providers beyond Claude Code, future-proofing the platform.

### Go-to-Market Recommendations

**1. Start with Strong Free Tier**
Launch with a generous free tier to reduce adoption friction and gather user feedback before introducing paid plans.

**2. Content Marketing Strategy**
Create educational content around AI-assisted development workflows to establish thought leadership and drive organic growth.

**3. Developer Community Outreach**
Target developer communities on Reddit, Discord, and Twitter with authentic engagement rather than promotional content.

**4. Integration Partnerships**
Partner with IDE providers (VS Code, Cursor) and CI/CD platforms (GitHub Actions) to embed Solo Unicorn into existing workflows.
