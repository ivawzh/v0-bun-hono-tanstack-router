# Solo Unicorn: Master Plan to Market

## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool focused on AI task management. The core idea is to separate Solo Unicorn from code execution, making it purely a task management system that coordinates with AI agents running on user machines through:

1. CLI SDK for user authentication and repo/agent registration
2. MCP tools for AI agents to update/create tasks
3. Passive communication system for backend to push tasks to agents
4. Potential backend uplift for robust communication (possibly Elixir WebSocket server)

## Market Analysis & Competitive Landscape

### Current Market Context (2024-2025)

**Market Size & Growth:**
- Global IDE Software Market: USD 2.4B in 2023 → USD 3.8B by 2030 (5.83% CAGR)
- Cloud IDE Market: USD 1.76B by 2030 (2.5% CAGR)
- North America leads with 42% market share, driven by major tech companies

**Key Market Drivers:**
- 76% of developers now using/planning to use AI coding assistants (up from 70%)
- Remote work adoption driving cloud-based development tools
- AI integration becoming standard in every major IDE by late 2024
- Growing demand for collaborative development environments

**Critical Market Insight:**
Despite AI tool adoption, a randomized controlled trial found developers take 19% longer when using AI tools - indicating current solutions have UX/workflow issues that Solo Unicorn could address.

### Competitive Landscape
