# Solo Unicorn: Dev Tool Market Launch Master Plan 2025

## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool focused on AI task management. The current idea involves:

1. CLI SDK for user authentication and repo initialization
2. MCP tool integration for AI agents to update/create tasks
3. Passive communication for backend task pushing
4. Backend separation of code agent logic and robust push communication

The request is open to complete rebuild suggestions and out-of-the-box thinking.

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** Transform Solo Unicorn into a **CLI-first AI task orchestration platform** targeting individual developers and small teams. Focus on becoming the "GitHub for AI agents" - a place where developers coordinate multiple AI agents across their projects with local control and cloud coordination.

**Key Insight:** The market gap isn't just task management - it's **AI agent orchestration**. Developers need a unified way to manage multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, local models) working on different aspects of their projects.

## Market Analysis & Competitive Intelligence

### Current Landscape Assessment

**Existing Tools & Limitations:**

1. **Claude Code** - Excellent for individual tasks, no project-wide coordination
2. **Cursor** - Great IDE integration, limited to coding tasks
3. **GitHub Copilot** - Code completion focused, no task management
4. **Devin/SWE-Agent** - Full autonomy but expensive and black-box
5. **Linear/Jira + AI** - Traditional PM tools with AI features bolted on

**Market Gap Identified:** No tool exists for **multi-agent AI coordination at the project level**.

### Industry Trends Supporting This Approach

1. **Multi-Agent AI Systems** - Trend toward specialized AI agents working together
2. **Local-First Development** - Developers want control over their code and data
3. **CLI Renaissance** - Modern developers prefer CLI tools (k8s, docker, git)
4. **MCP Protocol Adoption** - Standardization of AI tool communication
