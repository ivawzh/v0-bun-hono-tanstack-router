## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool focused on AI task management. The current idea involves:
- CLI SDK for user authentication and repo management
- AI agent integration via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Backend communication for task orchestration
- Passive communication system for pushing tasks to agents

## Market Analysis

### Market Size & Opportunity

The developer productivity tools market presents a compelling opportunity:
- **Global Software Development Tools Market**: $6.36B in 2024, projected to reach $27.07B by 2033 (17.47% CAGR)
- **Productivity Management Software**: $59.88B in 2023, growing to $149.74B by 2030 (14.1% CAGR)
- **Developer Population**: Expected to reach 28.7 million by 2024
- **AI Adoption**: 76% of developers using or planning to use AI coding assistants (up from 70%)

### Competitive Landscape

#### Direct Competitors (AI-Powered CLI Tools)
1. **Claude Code** - Terminal-based AI assistant with git integration
2. **Aider** - Open-source CLI tool for AI pair programming with Git repositories
3. **Amazon Q Developer** - Provides CLI agent alongside IDE integration
4. **GitHub Copilot CLI** - Command-line AI assistance

#### Adjacent Competitors (Task Management + AI)
1. **Linear** - Issue tracking with AI features
2. **Notion AI** - Document-based task management with AI
3. **CodeGPT** - Agentic AI platform for software development
4. **Cursor** - AI-first code editor with autonomous features

### Market Positioning Opportunity

**Gap Identified**: No existing tool specifically focuses on **AI task orchestration and delegation** as a standalone CLI service. Current tools either:
- Focus on direct coding assistance (Claude Code, Aider)
