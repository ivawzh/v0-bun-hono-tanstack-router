# Solo Unicorn: Master Plan for Market Entry

## Original Request

The goal is to create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a developer tool. The current idea is to position Solo Unicorn as an AI task management system focused on coding task orchestration, with the actual coding executed on user machines. The proposed approach includes:

1. CLI SDK for user authentication and repo registration
2. MCP tool integration for AI agents to communicate with backend
3. Passive communication system for pushing tasks to agents
4. Backend architecture updates to support distributed agent management

## Current State Analysis

### Solo Unicorn's Core Strengths
- **Minimal, Local-First Design**: Extreme simplification principle (one user, one machine, one session)
- **Intelligent Agent Orchestration**: Sophisticated 4-stage workflow (Todo → Doing → Done + Loop)
- **Multi-Mode Task Execution**: Clarify → Plan → Execute workflow with autonomous task breakdown
- **MCP Integration**: Already using Model Context Protocol for agent communication
- **Project Memory System**: Persistent context that enhances agent performance
- **Claude Code Integration**: Deep integration with the most powerful AI coding assistant

### Current Limitations
- **Single Machine Constraint**: Limited to local-only operation
- **Lambda Architecture Mismatch**: Current JS server designed for lambda, not real-time agent management
- **Limited Agent Support**: Currently only supports Claude Code
- **Scaling Challenges**: No multi-user, multi-project, or distributed capabilities

## Market Research & Competitive Analysis

### AI Coding Assistant Landscape (2024-2025)

**Market Leaders:**
1. **Cursor** ($20/month) - IDE-based, 500 fast premium requests
2. **Windsurf** ($15/month) - Real-time Flow technology, automatic context handling
3. **Claude Code** (token-based) - Terminal-based, high token usage, powerful but expensive
4. **GitHub Copilot** - Original market leader, widespread IDE integration

**Key Market Insights:**
- 76% of developers using or planning to use AI coding assistants (up from 70%)
- Multi-agent systems emerging as the future (specialized agents communicating)
- Autonomous Development Environments (ADEs) becoming the cutting edge
- CLI integration increasingly important alongside IDE features

### Task Management Tool Landscape

**Developer-Focused:**
