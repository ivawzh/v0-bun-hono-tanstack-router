# Solo Unicorn Market Strategy: AI Task Management Dev Tool

## Original Request

The current idea is to make Solo Unicorn a dev tool focused solely on AI task management. Solo Unicorn would be responsible for AI task management while coding happens on the user's machine (with potential future remote repo and remote AI coding).

The proposed approach:
1. **CLI SDK**: User login with JWT access/refresh tokens
2. **Repository Integration**: `init` command to register repo and agent with backend
3. **MCP Tool Integration**: Set up MCP tools for AI agents to update/create tasks
4. **Push Communication**: Backend pushes tasks to agents via passive communication

Backend considerations: Separation of code agent running logic and more robust push communication (possibly WebSocket server with Elixir instead of current JS/Lambda design).

## Analysis

### Current Solo Unicorn Strengths
- **Proven MCP Integration**: Already implements Model Context Protocol with TypeScript SDK
- **Claude Code Integration**: Deep integration with Claude Code agent via SDK (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- **Sophisticated Workflow**: 3-phase task execution (clarify → plan → execute) with loop cards
- **Project Memory**: Shared context across sessions stored in database
- **Session Management**: Hook system for lifecycle tracking and synchronization
- **Multi-repo Support**: Additional repositories for cross-codebase manipulation

### Current Architecture Limitations
- **Local-First Design**: Tied to one user, one machine, one session
- **Single Agent Type**: Only supports Claude Code (though extensible)
- **Lambda Architecture**: Current Hono/Bun server designed for serverless, not real-time push
