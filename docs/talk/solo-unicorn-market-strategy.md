# Solo Unicorn Market Strategy - Master Plan for Dev Tool Launch

## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool. Current idea: Make Solo Unicorn an AI task management tool where coding is done on user machine. Core features include:

1. CLI SDK for user login/auth with JWT tokens
2. Repository initialization (`init` command) to register repos and agents
3. MCP tool integration for AI agents to update/create tasks
4. Passive backend communication for task pushing (possibly WebSocket with Elixir)

Current backend may need uplift to separate agent running logic and provide more robust push communication.

## Analysis

### Current Solo Unicorn Strengths

**Unique Architecture & Positioning:**
- **Local-First Approach**: Unlike cloud-heavy competitors, Solo Unicorn keeps code on user machines
- **MCP Integration**: Already implements Model Context Protocol, which is becoming the 2025 standard (adopted by OpenAI, Microsoft, Google DeepMind)
- **Claude Code SDK Integration**: Direct integration with `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` package
- **Sophisticated Workflow**: 4-stage card lifecycle (clarify → plan → execute → done) with infinite Loop cards
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Rate limit handling with agent switching via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`

**Technical Foundation:**
- Modern tech stack: Bun, Hono + oRPC, React + TanStack Router, PostgreSQL
- MCP tools already implemented for task updates and project memory
- WebSocket infrastructure with Bun
- Hook system for Claude Code session lifecycle tracking
