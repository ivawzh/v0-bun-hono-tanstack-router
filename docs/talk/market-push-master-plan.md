# Solo Unicorn Market Push Master Plan

## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool focused on AI task management. The current idea involves developing a CLI SDK that enables:
1. User login with JWT tokens
2. Repository initialization and agent registration
3. MCP tool integration for AI task management
4. Passive communication for task pushing to agents

Backend considerations include separating code agent running logic and implementing robust push communication (potentially WebSocket server with Elixir).

## Analysis

### Current Architecture Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Solid foundation with React + TanStack Router, Hono + oRPC, and Bun runtime
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM provides robust data persistence
- MCP integration already implemented for AI communication
- WebSocket infrastructure in place for real-time updates
- Monster Auth provides secure user authentication

**Weaknesses:**
- Currently designed as a local-first system for single users
- Lambda-oriented server architecture may not scale for multi-tenant SaaS
- Tight coupling between UI and backend limits distribution flexibility
- No existing CLI interface for external developer access

### Market Position vs Competitors

Solo Unicorn would enter a competitive but rapidly growing market:

**Direct Competitors:**
- **Claude Task Master**: AI-powered task management for Cursor, Lovable, Windsurf
- **Gemini CLI**: Google's open-source AI agent for terminal-based task management
- **Amazon Q Developer CLI**: AWS's command completion and agentic chat interface

**Key Differentiators:**
- MCP-native integration provides standardized AI tool connectivity
- Focus on task orchestration rather than direct coding
- Project-based organization with memory persistence
- Loop cards for continuous improvement workflows

**Market Gaps:**
- Most existing tools focus on code generation rather than task management
- Limited cross-platform AI agent orchestration
- Lack of standardized protocols for AI task delegation
