# Solo Unicorn Market Strategy: Pushing to Market in 2025

## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool focused on AI task management. The current idea involves creating a CLI SDK that allows users to:
1. Login and get JWT access/refresh tokens
2. Initialize repos with `solo init` command
3. Set up MCP tools for AI agents to update/create tasks
4. Establish passive communication for backend task pushing

The owner is considering backend architecture changes, potentially moving from the current JavaScript server designed for Lambda to something more robust like Elixir WebSocket server, and is completely open to new ideas including complete rebuilds.
