# Solo Unicorn CLI-First Dev Tool Market Master Plan

## Task Information
- **Title**: Create a master plan to push this project to market
- **Description**: Transform Solo Unicorn into a CLI/SDK dev tool for AI task management with user machine coding execution

## Analysis: First-Principles Thinking

### The Core Problem We're Solving
**Related Problem**: Current AI coding tools lack intelligent task orchestration and context management across development sessions. Developers lose context, duplicate work, and struggle with task prioritization when working with AI assistants.

**Our Solution**: Solo Unicorn becomes the "task management brain" that sits between developers and their AI coding assistants, providing:
- Intelligent task breakdown and prioritization
- Context preservation across sessions
- Multi-repo coordination
- AI agent orchestration

### Market Reality Check
The current market has several gaps:
1. **GitHub Copilot**: Great at code completion, poor at project-level task management
2. **Cursor**: Excellent coding assistant, but no task orchestration
3. **Aider**: CLI-focused but lacks web UI and task management
4. **Devin**: Full automation but no human-in-the-loop control

**Our Differentiator**: We're the only solution focused purely on AI task orchestration while leaving coding execution to proven tools.

### First-Principles Architecture

The CLI-first approach is brilliant because:
1. **Developer Native**: CLI is where developers live
2. **Tool Agnostic**: Works with any AI coding assistant
3. **Minimal Friction**: One command to start task orchestration
4. **Local Security**: Code never leaves user's machine

## Options Analysis

### Option 1: Pure CLI Tool (Minimal Viable Product)
**Pros**: 
- Fastest to market (2-4 weeks)
- Minimal infrastructure costs
- Developer-friendly adoption
- Works offline

**Cons**:
- Limited monetization options
- No visual task management
- Harder to showcase value

**Implementation**:
- Standalone CLI executable
- Local SQLite database
- JWT auth with cloud backend
- MCP integration for AI agents

### Option 2: CLI + Web Dashboard Hybrid (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Best of both worlds
- Visual task management
- Team collaboration potential
- Clear monetization path

**Cons**:
- More complex architecture
- Requires web hosting
- Longer development time

**Implementation**:
- CLI for repo initialization and AI integration
- Web dashboard for task visualization
- Real-time sync via WebSocket
- Freemium model with team features

### Option 3: Full SaaS Platform
**Pros**:
- Maximum revenue potential
- Enterprise features
- Scalable architecture

**Cons**:
- Longest time to market
- High infrastructure costs
- Complex auth and security

**Implementation**:
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Enterprise authentication
- Advanced analytics and reporting

## Recommended Strategy: Option 2 (CLI + Web Hybrid)

### Phase 1: MVP CLI (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal**: Prove core value proposition with minimal viable product

**Core Features**:
- `solo init` - Initialize repo with Solo Unicorn
- `solo task create` - Create new tasks
- `solo task list` - View all tasks
- `solo agent connect` - Connect AI agents via MCP
- JWT authentication with cloud backend
- Local task storage with cloud sync

**Technical Stack**:
- **CLI**: Go or Rust for single binary distribution
- **Backend**: Keep current Node.js/Hono stack, deploy on Railway/Render
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (keep current schema)
- **Auth**: Expand current Monster Auth

### Phase 2: Web Dashboard (Weeks 5-8)
**Goal**: Add visual task management and team collaboration

**Additional Features**:
- Beautiful web dashboard for task visualization
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Project memory management interface
- Basic team invitation system
- Usage analytics

**Technical Additions**:
- **Frontend**: Current React/TanStack setup
- **WebSocket**: Upgrade to dedicated WebSocket server (consider Elixir/Phoenix for scale)
- **Deployment**: Separate CLI distribution from web service

### Phase 3: Growth & Enterprise (Weeks 9-16)
**Goal**: Scale to teams and enterprise customers

**Advanced Features**:
- Multi-repo project support
- Advanced AI agent management
- Team permission systems
- Integration marketplace (GitHub, Linear, Jira)
- Enterprise SSO

```

### Backend Modifications

**Current Architecture Enhancement**:
- Keep Hono/oRPC for API layer
- Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Implement CLI-specific authentication endpoints
- Add MCP tool registry for agent management

**Recommended Elixir WebSocket Server**:
```elixir
# Only if JavaScript performance becomes bottleneck
# Provides better concurrent connection handling
# Built-in distributed system capabilities
# Perfect for real-time task updates
```

### Authentication & Security

**CLI Authentication Flow**:
1. `solo auth login` - Opens browser for OAuth
2. Store JWT tokens in secure keychain
3. Automatic token refresh
4. Per-project API keys for MCP tools

**Security Considerations**:
- Never transmit code to cloud
- Encrypt local task storage
- Scope JWT tokens to specific projects
- Audit logs for all CLI operations

## Market Entry Strategy

### Target Customers

**Primary**: Solo developers and small teams (2-5 people)
- Individual developers using Claude Code, Cursor, or Aider
- Small startups with multiple repositories
- Freelancers managing client projects

**Secondary**: Development teams at mid-size companies
- Teams struggling with context loss across sprints
- Organizations using multiple AI coding tools
- Companies with complex multi-repo architectures

### Pricing Strategy

## Business Considerations

### Competitive Advantages
1. **First Mover**: No one else is doing AI task orchestration specifically
2. **Tool Agnostic**: Works with any AI coding assistant
3. **Local-First**: Code never leaves user's machine
4. **Developer Native**: Built by developers for developers

### Risk Mitigation
1. **AI Tool Integration Risk**: Keep MCP integration generic, avoid vendor lock-in
2. **Market Saturation Risk**: Focus on task orchestration niche, not general coding
3. **Technical Risk**: Start simple, iterate based on user feedback
4. **Competition Risk**: Open source core CLI to build community moat

### Revenue Projections

**Year 1 Conservative Estimate**:
- Users: 2,000 total, 200 paying
- Revenue: $18,000 ARR
- Costs: $6,000 (hosting, tools, marketing)
- Net: $12,000

**Year 1 Optimistic Estimate**:
- Users: 10,000 total, 1,000 paying
- Revenue: $90,000 ARR
- Costs: $20,000
- Net: $70,000

## UX Perspective

### Magical Developer Experience
1. **One Command Setup**: `solo init` analyzes repo and sets up everything automatically
2. **Intelligent Defaults**: Pre-configured task templates based on detected tech stack
3. **Seamless AI Integration**: AI agents automatically receive project context
4. **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with Claude Code, Cursor, Aider

### Friction Elimination
- Authentication: OAuth in browser, CLI stores tokens securely
- Task Creation: Natural language input gets automatically parsed
- Agent Communication: Transparent MCP integration, no manual setup
- Project Switching: `solo switch project-name` changes entire context

## Architectural Perspective

### System Design Principles
1. **CLI-First**: All functionality accessible via command line
2. **Local-First**: Core features work offline, sync when online
3. **Real-Time**: WebSocket updates for live collaboration
4. **Extensible**: Plugin system for custom AI agents and integrations

### Technology Choices Rationale

**CLI in Go/Rust**: 
- Single binary distribution
- Cross-platform compatibility
- No runtime dependencies
- Fast startup times

**Keep Current Backend**:
- Node.js/Hono proven for this use case
- oRPC provides type safety
- PostgreSQL handles current scale
- Faster iteration vs. rewrite

**Optional Elixir WebSocket Server**:
- Only when JavaScript hits limits
- Better concurrent connection handling
- Built-in distributed capabilities
- Phoenix LiveView for real-time features

## Conclusion

The CLI-first approach is the correct strategy. It leverages developer preferences, minimizes infrastructure complexity, and provides the fastest path to market validation. The hybrid model (CLI + Web) gives us the best of both worlds: developer adoption through CLI and business scalability through web features.

**Next Steps**:
1. Validate CLI concept with 10 alpha users
2. Build MVP CLI in Go/Rust (4 weeks)
3. Launch web dashboard for task visualization
4. Execute aggressive developer marketing strategy

The market opportunity is real, the technical approach is sound, and the timing is perfect as AI coding tools mature but lack proper task orchestration.
