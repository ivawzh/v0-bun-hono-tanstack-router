3. **Fast**: Sub-100ms response time for common operations
4. **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for new agents and integrations

**Proposed CLI Structure:**
```
solo-cli/
├── core/
│   ├── auth.rs          # JWT token management
│   ├── config.rs        # Local configuration management
│   └── database.rs      # Local SQLite operations
├── commands/
│   ├── auth.rs          # login, logout, status
│   ├── init.rs          # Repository initialization  
│   ├── task.rs          # Task CRUD operations
│   ├── agent.rs         # Agent management
