# Solo Unicorn Market Launch Master Plan

## Original Request

Create a master plan to push Solo Unicorn to market as a dev tool focused on AI task management, with a CLI SDK approach for user authentication, repo registration, MCP integration, and passive communication for task distribution.

## Analysis

### Current State Assessment
- Solo Unicorn is a comprehensive task management system with Claude Code integration
- Architecture includes web UI, server API, and direct Claude Code process spawning
- Currently designed for local-first, single-user operation
- Has solid foundation with oRPC, WebSocket communication, and MCP integration

### Market Position Analysis
Solo Unicorn would enter the rapidly growing "AI-assisted development tools" market, competing with:
- **GitHub Copilot** - Code completion and chat
- **Cursor** - AI-first code editor
- **Aider** - Command-line AI pair programmer
- **Continue** - VS Code extension for AI coding
- **Devin/SWE-Agent** - Autonomous coding agents
- **Sweep AI** - AI-powered issue resolution

**Key Differentiator**: Task orchestration layer that sits above the coding tools, managing the flow of work to AI agents rather than being the coding tool itself.

## Research & Findings

### Similar Tools Analysis

**1. Linear + AI Integration Approach**
- Linear manages tasks, integrates with development tools
- Clean separation of concerns: task management vs. execution
- API-first approach enables ecosystem integrations

**2. Zapier Model**
- Orchestration platform connecting different services
- User owns the tools, Zapier manages the workflows
- Strong CLI and API integration patterns

**3. GitHub Actions Paradigm**
- YAML-based workflow definition

- Marketplace of reusable actions

**4. Vercel/Netlify CLI Pattern**
- Simple authentication flow (login, link project)
- Local development with cloud orchestration
- Push-based deployments

### Market Readiness Assessment

**Strengths:**
- First-mover advantage in AI task orchestration space
- Strong technical foundation with oRPC/MCP integration
- Clear value proposition: "AI project manager for developers"

**Challenges:**
