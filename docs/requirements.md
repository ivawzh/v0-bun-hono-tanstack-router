# Solo Unicorn ‚Äî MVP Requirements

## Vision and Goal

Build a web-based, agent-tasked workflow app with a Trello-inspired Kanban GUI for creating and dispatching coding tasks to AI agents. The MVP focuses on a board-first experience with a right-side task drawer for detailed task management and agent collaboration.

- Optimize for single-user, local-first usage with mobile-friendly access
- MVP supports a single owner, multiple projects, each with repositories and AI agents
- Use Solo Unicorn to recursively and continuously improve itself

## Principles

- Think small: ignore performance, cost, and scalability at MVP. Aim for simplicity and ease of use with day-0 mindset.
- Single-user only (you)
- Local-first: primary usage from your environment; mobile browser occasionally
- Auth: every endpoint/operation must pass through Monster Auth guard even though it's not yet perfect or implemented
- Access control: every S3 bucket or similar cloud storage must have at least a basic access control policy
- **Git Pull Rebase Strategy**: Minimize modifications to maintain compatibility with upstream updates via `git pull --rebase`. Keep customizations in separate files/folders when possible to avoid merge conflicts.
- **Reactive UXUI**: Upon user interaction, implement real-time UI updates either by invalidating all queries or via WebSocket connections for immediate feedback and responsive user experience.
- **Default Best Config**: Provide optimal default settings and configurations out-of-the-box, while allowing users to customize via UI, API, or environment variables. Assume sensible defaults for common use cases.
- **Idempotency Everywhere**: All mutating operations (API writes, task/status/stage transitions, agent actions, webhook deliveries) must be safe to retry. Use idempotency keys and unique constraints; prefer UPSERTs; make event handling dedupe-safe.
- Tech stack (aligned with this repo):
  - Web: React + TanStack Router (apps/web)
  - UI: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui component library
  - Server: Hono + oRPC (apps/server)
  - Runtime: Bun
  - ORM: Drizzle
  - Database: PGlite for local development; Supabase PostgreSQL for production
  - Hosting: Vercel (app + server functions), Supabase (DB/Storage)
  - Validation: Valibot
- Agent runner on personal Windows PC

## Database Implementation (Day-0 pragmatism)

- Prefer jsonb for flexible fields (`metadata`, `payload`, `config`, etc.)
- Minimize up-front normalization; evolve schema later as patterns stabilize
- Local dev DB: Local PostgreSQL (using pg-god for management)
- Production DB: Supabase PostgreSQL; seamless migration when ready
- Index selectively and defer advanced indexing
- Keep migrations small and reversible; refactor-friendly

## UI/UX Design (MVP)

### Board-First Approach

- **Primary View**: Trello-inspired Kanban board with drag-and-drop columns
- **Task Details**: Right-side slide-over drawer for fast drill-in and edits
- **Mobile**: Columns scroll horizontally; task opens in full-screen sheet

### Columns and Status

- **Status Lanes**: `Todo`, `In Progress`, `QA`, `Done`
- **Optional Lane**: `Paused` (collapsed by default)
- **Blocked Flag**: Boolean flag with ‚õî badge (not a separate column)
- **QA Flow**: Dedicated QA column; tasks can skip QA if not required

### Task Cards

- Display: Title, priority badge, stage chip, assignee avatar/name
- Badges: blocked (‚õî), attachments count (üìé), comments (üí¨), questions (‚ùì)
- Controls: Auto-Start toggle, Agent Paused indicator
- Claude Code integration: "Open in Claude Code" link to active sessions

### Task Drawer (Slide-over)

Comprehensive task management with tabs:

- **Overview**: Description (Markdown + voice input), metadata, quick toggles
- **Kickoff**: Challenge idea, options list & ranking, selected option, spec (with history)
- **Checklist**: Stage-specific checklist items
- **Comments**: Task-scoped conversation with voice input support
- **Attachments**: Image thumbnails with preview, file uploads
- **Events**: Assignment history, status/stage changes, artifacts
- **Questions**: Agent questions to human, blocking workflow until answered

### Agent Controls

- **Per-Task**: Auto-Start toggle, Start/Pause Agent, Ask Human
- **Project-Level**: "Pause All Agents" suspends all agent activity
- **Session Linking**: Direct links to Claude Code sessions for active tasks
- **Claude Code Integration**:
  - Projects configure local repo path and Claude project ID
  - Tasks automatically dispatched to Claude Code UI
  - Real-time WebSocket communication for task status

## In-Scope (MVP)

- **Core Entities**: Projects, repositories, boards, and tasks
- **Task Management**:
  - Status: `todo`, `in_progress`, `qa`, `done`, `paused`
  - Stages: `kickoff`, `spec`, `design`, `dev`, `qa`, `done`
  - Blocking flag (independent of status)
  - QA Required toggle (controls flow through QA column)
- **Agent Integration**:
  - Assign tasks to agents or humans
  - Start/pause agent sessions with Claude Code integration
  - Agent auto-start on stage triggers (configurable per task)
  - Project-wide agent pause controls
  - Claude Code UI integration via git submodule
  - WebSocket server for real-time agent communication
  - Claude Code hooks for task pickup and completion
  - Project-level configuration for local repo path and Claude project ID
- **Collaboration Features**:
  - Task-scoped comments with voice input (OpenAI Audio API)
  - Agent questions that block workflow until human answers
  - Assignment history tracking
  - Attachment support with image preview
- **Kickoff Workflow**:
  - Structured kickoff process (challenge ‚Üí options ‚Üí selection ‚Üí spec)
  - Persistent history of all kickoff iterations
  - Stage-specific checklists
- **Authentication**: Monster Auth (Google OAuth) for single owner
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design with horizontal scrolling columns

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Multi-user, permissions, and organizations
- Performance optimization and horizontal scale
- Robust CI/CD integrations and test orchestration
- Full Git integration beyond optional commit links
- Multiple concurrent agents or multi-tenant support
- Multiple chat channels (single project chat only)

## Updated Data Model (UI-Aligned)

Key changes from UI/UX requirements:

### Task Model Updates

- **Status**: Include `qa`, remove `blocked` as status ‚Üí `todo | in_progress | qa | done | paused`
- **New Fields**:
  - `is_blocked boolean default false` (blocked becomes a flag)
  - `qa_required boolean default false` (controls flow through QA column)
  - `agent_ready boolean default false` (card-level control for auto-start)

### Project Model Updates

- **New Fields**:
  - `agent_paused boolean default false` (project-level Pause All)
  - `local_repo_path text` (path to local git repository)
  - `claude_project_id text` (Claude Code project ID for linking)

### Agent Pool and Rate Limits

- Multiple `agent` rows represent the pool (single-user MVP may use one Claude Code agent)
- Agent-centric Rate-Limit Controller (Claude Code):
  - Enforce single active session (concurrency=1)
  - Persist agent state: `idle|starting|running|paused|rate_limited|error`
  - Record incidents in `agent_incidents` with fields: `agent_id`, `type=rate_limit|error`, `occurred_at`, `message`, `provider_hint`, `inferred_reset_at`, `next_retry_at`, `resolved_at`, `resolution`
  - On rate limit, compute ETA if possible; otherwise backoff with jitter (e.g., 5/10/20/40m; cap 60m)
  - Auto-resume by scheduled retries; log outcomes
  - UI: header chip with countdown, card ‚ÄúNeeds attention‚Äù badge, drawer/banner with auto-resume ETA
  - Prevent auto-move to Done on ambiguous/failed runs; allow human confirm/reopen

### Assignment History

- Extend `task_event.type` to include `assigned | unassigned | reassigned`
- Payload includes `from`, `to`, and `by` for full audit trail

### Attachments

- Use `task_artifact kind=file` labeled as "Attachment" in UI
- `meta.contentType` enables image preview and thumbnails
- Support drag-and-drop and mobile upload

### Kickoff History

- Store structured entries under `task.metadata.kickoff`:
  - Arrays of timestamped records for: `challenge_md`, `options_md` (with ranks), `selected_option`, `spec_md`
- Mirror significant updates as `task_event` for auditability

### Chat Integration

New tables for project-level chat:

- `chat_channel`: id, scope_type `project|board|task`, scope_id, name, topic, created_at
- `chat_message`: id, channel_id, parent_message_id (threading), author `human|agent|system`, content_md, mentions jsonb[], at
- Mentions store canonical references: `{type:"agent|user|role", id, label}`

## Requirements Storage (Updated Decision)

**Selected Approach**: Git-based project wiki as submodule

- Each project has a dedicated wiki repository for requirements/documentation
- Project wiki repo added as git submodule in each code repository
- Benefits:
  - Version-controlled and reviewable
  - Claude Code and other agents can access via git submodule
  - Decoupled from code but easily accessible
  - Familiar Git workflow for documentation updates

Implementation:

- Link requirements docs from tasks via `task.metadata.requirement_refs`
- Support section anchors for specific requirement linking
- Agents can pull read-only access to wiki submodule for context

## Notification Strategy (Updated Decision)

**Selected Approach**: Both in-app and webhook notifications

- **In-App**: Real-time notifications for questions, blockers, stage changes
- **Webhook**: Configurable endpoints for external integrations
- **Future**: Email notifications as optional enhancement

Implementation:

- `notification` table with `channel` field supporting `inapp|webhook`
- Webhook payload format standardized for easy integration
- In-app notifications with real-time updates via WebSocket

## Voice Input Integration (Updated Decision)

**Selected Approach**: Server-side transcription via OpenAI Audio API

- **Scope**: Available on description fields, comment inputs, and chat
- **Implementation**: Toggle button (üé§) on supported text areas
- **Processing**: Audio sent to OpenAI Audio API for transcription
- **UX**: Real-time feedback with transcription insertion

## Agent Assignment (Updated Decision)

**Selected Approach**: Allow non-code agent assignments in MVP

- **Supported Roles**: PM, Designer, Architect, Engineer, QA agents
- **Implementation**: `agent.role` field with predefined roles
- **UI**: Role-based assignment dropdown and filtering
- **Future**: Custom role definitions and capabilities

## Core Workflows

1. **Project Setup**: Create project ‚Üí add repositories ‚Üí create boards ‚Üí add tasks
2. **Task Assignment**: Assign to agent/human or allow agent claiming
3. **Stage Pipeline**: `kickoff ‚Üí spec ‚Üí design ‚Üí dev ‚Üí qa ‚Üí done`
4. **Kickoff Process**: Challenge idea ‚Üí list options ‚Üí rank ‚Üí select ‚Üí write spec
5. **Agent Sessions**: Start agent ‚Üí execute actions ‚Üí produce artifacts ‚Üí complete
6. **Human-in-Loop**: Questions block workflow until human answers
7. **QA Flow**: Tasks with `qa_required=true` must pass through QA column

## Stage Flow and Automation

- **Default Pipeline**: `kickoff ‚Üí spec ‚Üí design ‚Üí dev ‚Üí qa ‚Üí done`
- **Stage Change Triggers**:
  - Notify assigned actor
  - Start/stop agent session based on `agent_ready` flag
  - Create next-stage checklist
  - Handle QA skip logic (if `qa_required=false`)
- **Agent Controls**:
  - Per-task auto-start toggle
  - Project-level pause all agents
  - Manual start/pause always available

## API Surface (MVP)

**Authentication**: All routes protected by `requireOwnerAuth()` or `requireAgentAuth()`
