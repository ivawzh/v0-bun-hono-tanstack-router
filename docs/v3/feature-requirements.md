# Solo Unicorn v3 Feature Requirements

## Document Purpose

This document captures high-level feature requirements that cover all public interfaces including CLI, Web UI, and future public APIs. The role of this document is to serve as the central registry for feature requirements and dependencies.

**Usage Pattern**: When adding new features, AI agents should:
1. **First**: Add requirements to this document
2. **Then**: Choose appropriate design documents (cli-design.md, web-design.md, db-design.md) to implement the feature
3. **Finally**: Update implementation documents with detailed specifications

This ensures comprehensive feature coverage across all interfaces and maintains consistency between CLI, Web, and API implementations.
