# Story 01.02: kanban-read-only-with-mission-card

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** project member,
**I want** a read-only Kanban board with MissionCard previews,
**so that** I can visualize mission status across Todo/Doing/Review/Done before enabling interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) Render four columns: Todo, Doing, Review, Done. Todo column keeps room for Normal/Loop layout (loop collapsible later).
3) MissionCard layout follows 002-web-design: title line; badges (priority, stage, process/PR placeholder); 3.5-line truncated description; Ready button disabled.
4) Responsive: horizontal scroll on mobile; fixed column heights with internal scroll.
5) Data fetched via mocked /rpc.mission.list(projectId) only; no /api usage.
6) TanStack Query key: ['mission','list', projectId]. Use skeletons while loading.
7) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- mission.list(projectId)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement KanbanBoard component with 4 columns (AC 2).
- [ ] Implement MissionCard UI per spec with badges and truncated description, Ready disabled (AC 3).
- [ ] Hook up useMissionList(projectId) -> ['mission','list', projectId] with skeleton loaders (AC 6).
- [ ] Responsive CSS and overflow scrolling; mobile horizontal scroll (AC 4).
- [ ] Server: apps/server/src/routers/rpc/missions.ts with mission.list; wire mockData with representative missions across lists (AC 5).
- [ ] Integrate with project selector from 01.01; re-fetch on project change.

## Dev Notes
- Follow 002-web-design and front-end-spec components and structure.
- Cards in Review show PR badge placeholder; no actions yet.

### Testing
- Smoke: renders four columns; cards appear in correct columns.
- Snapshot or visual assertion for skeletons and truncation.
