# Story 01.12: accessibility-and-responsiveness

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user of varying abilities and devices,
**I want** accessible, responsive interactions across core screens,
**so that** I can use the app effectively on desktop and mobile with assistive technologies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) Achieve baseline WCAG 2.2 AA for: Header/Subheader, KanbanBoard, MissionModal, MissionCreatePopup.
3) Keyboard navigation: focus-visible outlines, tab order, Esc closes modals, traps focus inside modals.
4) ARIA labeling: buttons, toggles, modal regions, badges (tooltips or aria-describedby).
5) Responsive: Kanban horizontal scroll on mobile, fixed heights with internal scroll; modal layouts adapt.
6) No new /rpc endpoints required; no /api usage.
7) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- None

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add focus-visible and keyboard navigation improvements to header, board, modals (AC 3).
- [ ] Add aria labels and roles to key controls; ensure badges are accessible (AC 4).
- [ ] Responsive refinements for board and modals (AC 5).

## Dev Notes
- Use testing-library queries that prefer accessible roles.

### Testing
- Keyboard-only walkthrough; verify Esc behavior, focus trap, and tab order.
- Snapshot of mobile layout for Kanban and modals.
