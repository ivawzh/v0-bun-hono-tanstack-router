# Story 01.07: kanban-drag-and-drop-reorder-and-list-moves

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user organizing work,
**I want** to drag missions within and across columns,
**so that** I can quickly reorder and move missions between Todo/Doing/Review/Done.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) Enable drag-and-drop for reordering within a column and moving between columns.
3) Keyboard-accessible reorder is desirable; if out of scope, document as follow-up.
4) Persist order and list via mocked /rpc.mission.reorder; debounce updates to avoid spam.
5) Cache invalidation of ['mission','list', projectId] after persistence; optimistic local reorder is allowed.
6) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- mission.reorder({ projectId, moves: Array<{ missionId, fromList, toList, toIndex }> })

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Introduce DnD layer (e.g., @dnd-kit or react-beautiful-dnd) and wire to KanbanBoard (AC 2).
- [ ] Local optimistic reorder and list move; debounce and persist to mocked endpoint (AC 4,5).
- [ ] Server: missions.ts add mission.reorder; update list and list_order in mockData (AC 4).
- [ ] Document keyboard-accessible plan in Dev Notes if not delivered (AC 3).

## Dev Notes
- Respect responsive/mobile; large drop targets in small viewports.

### Testing
- Simulate drag order change persists and reload reflects same.
