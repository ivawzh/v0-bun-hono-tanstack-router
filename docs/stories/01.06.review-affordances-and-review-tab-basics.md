# Story 01.06: review-affordances-and-review-tab-basics

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** reviewer,
**I want** to see review affordances on cards and use a Review tab to approve or reject,
**so that** I can move missions through Review → Done or back to Doing with feedback.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) Review column cards show PR status badge placeholder and optional PR link placeholder.
3) Review tab shows review instructions text and buttons: Approve and Reject.
4) Reject requires feedback; on Approve → move to Done; on Reject → move to Doing and store feedback.
5) Data via mocked /rpc.mission.review; no /api usage.
6) Invalidate ['mission','list', projectId] and ['mission','get', missionId] on decision.
7) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- mission.review({ missionId, decision: 'approve' | 'reject', feedback? })

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Add PR badge placeholder and link on Review column cards (AC 2).
- [ ] Implement Review tab in MissionModal with instruction text (AC 3).
- [ ] Validate Reject requires feedback; update list transitions accordingly (AC 4).
- [ ] useReviewMission mutation; invalidate relevant queries (AC 5,6).
- [ ] Server: missions.ts add mission.review; update mockData for list changes and optional feedback (AC 5).

## Dev Notes
- Follow 002-web-design on card variants and Review tab layout.

### Testing
- Smoke: Approve moves card to Done; Reject without feedback blocked; Reject with feedback returns to Doing.
