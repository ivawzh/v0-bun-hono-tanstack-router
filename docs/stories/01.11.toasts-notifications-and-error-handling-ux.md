# Story 01.11: toasts-notifications-and-error-handling-ux

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** consistent feedback via toasts and robust error/empty states,
**so that** I can understand the result of actions and recover from errors gracefully.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) Add toasts (success/failure) for key mutations (create, update, toggleReady, review, reorder).
3) Standardize empty and error states for list views and modals.
4) Introduce error boundary wrapper in appropriate places.
5) No new /rpc endpoints required; reuse mocks from previous stories. No /api usage.
6) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- None new (reuse mission.* and project.* mocks)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Integrate Sonner (or existing component) for toasts; add in mutation onSuccess/onError handlers (AC 2).
- [ ] Add standardized Empty and Error components for list and modal sections (AC 3).
- [ ] Add an ErrorBoundary component and wrap key routes/components (AC 4).

## Dev Notes
- Ensure messages are clear, concise, and actionable.

### Testing
- Simulate mutation success/failure and verify toasts; force error to trigger ErrorBoundary.
