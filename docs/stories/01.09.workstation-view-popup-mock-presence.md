# Story 01.09: workstation-view-popup-mock-presence

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** project member,
**I want** to view workstation presence and details in a popup,
**so that** I can understand availability and context for agent execution.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) WorkstationView modal/pages with tabs: Overview, Agents, Repositories, Activity.
3) Presence reflects online/offline from mocks; show quick stats on Overview.
4) Data via mocked /rpc.workstation.list(projectId) and /rpc.workstation.get(workstationId); no /api usage.
5) Cache keys: ['workstation','list', projectId], ['workstation','get', workstationId]; skeletons on load.
6) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- workstation.list(projectId)
- workstation.get(workstationId)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement WorkstationView modal with tab structure and responsive layout (AC 2).
- [ ] Hooks for list and get; skeletons; presence indicators (AC 3,4,5).
- [ ] Server: workstations.ts add workstation.list/get and sample mockData with a few workstations (AC 4).

## Dev Notes
- Use presence model hints from docs/003-cli-design.md and docs/architecture.md.

### Testing
- Smoke: list shows online/offline counts; details reflect fields.
