# Story 01.10: public-project-view-permission-aware-read-only

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** public visitor or authenticated user,
**I want** a permission-aware public project view (read-only),
**so that** I can learn about a project and see completed missions with visibility rules applied.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) PublicProjectView shows tabs: Overview, Missions (completed), Contributors, Analytics. Contribute/Request Access button placeholder.
3) Honor visibility flags from mock server (001-feature-requirements Public Projects section). Anonymous users see only public-allowed data.
4) Use mocked /rpc.publicProject.get(publicSlug) and /rpc.publicProject.missions(publicSlug); no /api usage.
5) Cache keys: ['publicProject','get', publicSlug], ['publicProject','missions', publicSlug]. Skeletons on load.
6) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- publicProject.get(publicSlug)
- publicProject.missions(publicSlug)

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement PublicProjectView modal/page with tabs and placeholders (AC 2).
- [ ] Hooks for get and missions with keys above (AC 4,5).
- [ ] Server: publicProjects.ts add publicProject.get and publicProject.missions; provide visibility fields in mockData (AC 3,4).

## Dev Notes
- Reflect permission-aware behavior per 001-feature-requirements and front-end-spec PublicProjectView.

### Testing
- Smoke: anonymous vs authenticated render differences simulated by toggling mock visibility flags.
