# Story 01.08: project-settings-modal-stubs

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** project administrator,
**I want** a Project Settings modal with key tabs and minimal persistence,
**so that** I can prepare the configuration UI for future functionality while wiring basic General settings to mocks.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) Modal with tabs: General, Members, Repositories, Actors, Flows.
3) General tab includes minimal editable fields (e.g., project name/description) and persists to mock via /rpc.project.update.
4) Other tabs show read-only stubs or status badges; no heavy editing yet.
5) Cache invalidation for ['project','get', projectId] (and ['project','list'] if affected) after update.
6) No /api usage; RPC only.
7) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- project.update({ projectId, name?, description? })

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement ProjectSettingsModal with tab structure and accessibility (AC 2).
- [ ] General tab form with validation; mutation useUpdateProject and invalidation (AC 3,5).
- [ ] Members/Repositories/Actors/Flows tabs: placeholders with status badges (AC 4).
- [ ] Server: projects.ts add project.update and update mockData (AC 3).

## Dev Notes
- UI patterns per 002-web-design and front-end-spec; align naming and spacing.

### Testing
- Smoke: open/close modal, tab switch works; updating General persists and reflects after refetch.
