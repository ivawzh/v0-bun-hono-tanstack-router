# Story 01.16: backlog-cleanup-and-small-fixes

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** maintainer,
**I want** a small backlog cleanup and fixes story,
**so that** we can address minor UX and code hygiene issues discovered during the sprint without exceeding per-story limits.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) Addresses only small changes that fit < 300 LOC and are safe and well-tested.
3) No new /rpc endpoints unless trivial to add and clearly required by minor UX fix.
4) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- None (prefer reuse); add only if absolutely necessary.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Enumerate tiny fixes (spelling, aria labels, spacing) and apply.
- [ ] Add/adjust a test or two if needed.

## Dev Notes
- Keep scope tiny and focused.

### Testing
- Smoke relevant views; run unit tests for touched files.
