# Story 01.15: to-be-added-if-needed

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** maintainer,
**I want** a placeholder for any additional scope we discover during implementation,
**so that** we can add another focused, single-session story without overloading existing ones.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) The final title, AC, tasks, and RPCs will be defined by the SM when needed.
3) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- TBD

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Define concrete scope when needed.

## Dev Notes
- Use only if scope grows.

### Testing
- TBD
