# Story 01.14: theming-and-dark-mode-polish

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** polished light/dark themes with clear badges and card legibility,
**so that** the UI feels consistent and readable in both modes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1) Must start by reading the ENTIRE docs list shown at the top of this file.
2) Ensure badges (priority/stage/PR) and cards are legible with sufficient contrast in both themes.
3) Validate key screens: Header/Subheader, Kanban, MissionModal, CreatePopup.
4) Theme toggle works reliably; no layout shifts.
5) No new /rpc endpoints required; no /api usage.
6) Keep within single session (≤ 14k context) and < 1000 lines changed.

RPC methods to stub on server:
- None

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Audit tokens and component styles for dark/light; adjust colors.
- [ ] Verify badge color tokens and hover/focus states.
- [ ] Visual checks on key screens; add examples in Dev Notes if helpful.

## Dev Notes
- Follow front-end-spec design system guidance; keep contrast ≥ WCAG AA.

### Testing
- Smoke: theme toggle changes are applied; screenshots for both themes.
