# Mobile Testing Guide - Solo Unicorn

This document outlines the mobile optimizations implemented and provides testing guidelines for ensuring a polished mobile experience.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Touch-Friendly Drag and Drop
- **TouchSensor**: Dedicated touch sensor with 250ms delay and 8px tolerance for accurate mobile dragging
- **MouseSensor**: Desktop mouse interaction sensor with 8px distance constraint
- **PointerSensor**: Fallback for broader device compatibility
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Visual scaling and shadow effects during drag operations

### 2. Touch Target Compliance
- **Minimum Size**: All interactive elements meet the 44px minimum touch target requirement
- **Enhanced Buttons**: Main action buttons are 44px+ with proper padding
- **Switch Controls**: Task ready toggles are properly sized for touch interaction
- **Menu Buttons**: Dropdown triggers and action buttons meet accessibility standards

### 3. Touch Feedback and Visual Cues
- **Active States**: Scale animation (0.98x) on touch for immediate feedback
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle scale up (1.02x) on hover for desktop users
- **Enhanced Shadows**: Dynamic shadow depth changes during interactions
- **Focus Indicators**: Visible focus rings for keyboard/touch navigation

### 4. Mobile-Specific Enhancements
- **iOS Zoom Prevention**: 16px font size on inputs to prevent automatic zoom
- **Touch Manipulation**: CSS `touch-action: manipulation` for better performance
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Enhanced scroll behavior with momentum scrolling
- **User Selection**: Disabled text selection on interactive elements

### 5. Responsive Layout Improvements
- **Column Sizing**: Adaptive Kanban column widths (280px mobile → 350px desktop)
- **Card Spacing**: Optimized gaps and padding for different screen sizes
- **Text Wrapping**: Improved typography with proper word breaking and hyphenation
- **Viewport Optimization**: Full viewport height utilization with proper overflow handling

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Android Tablet (768×1024px)

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Very narrow (320px width)
- [ ] Landscape orientation on mobile
- [ ] Large tablet landscape (1024×768px)

### Core Interactions to Test

#### Drag and Drop
- [ ] Drag tasks between columns (Todo → Doing → Done)
- [ ] Reorder tasks within the same column
- [ ] Long press to initiate drag (250ms delay)
- [ ] Visual feedback during drag operation
- [ ] Drop accuracy and visual feedback
- [ ] Cancel drag with swipe away

#### Touch Targets
- [ ] All buttons are easily tappable (44px minimum)
- [ ] Toggle switches respond accurately
- [ ] Dropdown menus open correctly
- [ ] Small action buttons (edit, delete) are accessible
- [ ] Card tap area covers entire card surface

#### Form Interactions
- [ ] Input fields don't trigger zoom on iOS
- [ ] Textarea resizing works properly
- [ ] Select dropdowns are easily navigable
- [ ] Form submission buttons are prominent
- [ ] Virtual keyboard doesn't hide critical elements

#### Navigation and Scrolling
- [ ] Horizontal scroll in Kanban board is smooth
- [ ] Vertical scroll in columns works properly
- [ ] Momentum scrolling feels natural
- [ ] No unintended scroll interference during drag
- [ ] Proper scroll boundaries and overscroll behavior

### Accessibility Testing

#### Focus Management
- [ ] Tab navigation follows logical order
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible and clear
- [ ] Touch navigation with screen readers
- [ ] Focus doesn't get trapped in modals
- [ ] Skip links work properly

#### Screen Reader Compatibility
- [ ] Proper ARIA labels on interactive elements
- [ ] Drag and drop operations are announced
- [ ] Status changes are communicated
- [ ] Form validation messages are accessible
- [ ] Modal dialogs are properly announced

#### Visual Accessibility
- [ ] Sufficient color contrast ratios
- [ ] No reliance on color alone for information
- [ ] Text remains readable at 200% zoom
- [ ] Motion preferences are respected
- [ ] High contrast mode compatibility

## Mobile Test Helper

The codebase includes a `MobileTestHelper` component that provides:

### Visual Testing Aids
- **Screen Size Indicator**: Shows current viewport dimensions
- **Device Detection**: Identifies common mobile devices by screen size
- **Touch Target Overlay**: Visual indicators for minimum touch target compliance

### Usage
1. Enable by setting `enabled={true}` in development
2. Toggle touch target overlay with the floating debug button
3. Red outlines indicate interactive elements
4. Yellow dashed boxes show 44px minimum touch areas

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Type checking
bun typecheck

# Build verification
bun run build

# Development server
bun dev
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Transform-based animations**: Hardware accelerated transitions
- **Minimal reflows**: CSS transforms instead of layout changes
- **Efficient selectors**: Scoped component styles
- **Touch event optimization**: Passive event listeners where appropriate

### Monitoring
- Watch for janky animations during drag operations
- Monitor scroll performance, especially on older devices
- Test memory usage during extended drag sessions
- Verify touch responsiveness on various device types

## Common Issues and Solutions

### iOS Safari Specific
- **Issue**: Input zoom on focus
- **Solution**: 16px font-size on input elements

- **Issue**: Scroll momentum not working
- **Solution**: `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`

### Android Chrome Specific
- **Issue**: Touch delay on buttons
- **Solution**: `touch-action: manipulation`

- **Issue**: Double-tap zoom interference
- **Solution**: Proper viewport meta tag

### Cross-Platform
- **Issue**: Drag sensitivity too high/low
- **Solution**: Calibrated sensor constraints (250ms delay, 8px tolerance)

- **Issue**: Focus outline not visible
- **Solution**: Forced focus-visible styles with high contrast

## Implementation Notes

All touch optimizations are implemented with progressive enhancement:
1. **Base functionality** works on all devices
2. **Touch enhancements** activate on touch-capable devices
3. **Desktop optimizations** provide hover states where supported
4. **Accessibility features** work across all input methods

The mobile optimizations maintain full feature parity with desktop while providing a native-feeling touch experience.
